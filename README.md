# m-youtube-webapp
An APK file that installs a webapp with YouTube. Made for older devices running KitKat and older without YouTube updates, however it may/may not work with Lolipop/5.0+.
If you get prompted with the Google Play prompt, just hit "INSTALL ANYWAY", it is perfectly safe and I use it on my android tablet with Android 4.4.2.
